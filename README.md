## Class3_Getting_And_Cleaning_Data_Course_Project
#This is a  repository for the Course Project for the third course in the John Hopkins/ Coursera Data Science Certification. It contains the R code & documentation files for the "Getting And Cleaning Data" Course Project.

#The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
#R Code and Documentation Files

#The code takes for granted all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

#CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

#run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

#The output of the 5th step is called averages_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
